## Section two

...
```

Maintainers can also populate DOI metadata automatically at deploy time via `data/zenodo.json` when `ZENODO_API_TOKEN` is configured in GitHub Actions.

See [BLOG_SPEC.md](./BLOG_SPEC.md) for full frontmatter and tag options.

## References

End every post with a numbered References section citing the primary literature
it builds on, giving each entry a DOI or publisher link where one exists:

This is not required for acceptance, but it appears to matter for whether the
post shows up in Google Scholar. Scholar only indexes documents it classifies
as scholarly articles, and a bibliography seems to be one of the signals it
uses. We can't see Google's classifier, so treat this as an observation rather
than a rule — but across our own posts, the ones with DOI-linked reference
lists were indexed and the ones without were not, independent of length or
publication date. See the [submission
guidelines](https://genomicsxai.github.io/submission-guidelines/#why-references-matter-for-google-scholar).
