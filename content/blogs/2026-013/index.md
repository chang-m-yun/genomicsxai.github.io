## Quick-start guide (5 min)
Below, we review the basics of navigating an ENCODE model annotation page and explain how to load the most commonly used resource files into the WashU genome browser. 
We recommend visualizing the files as a first step in designing any larger-scale quantitative analyses.

We use the example of a **ChromBPNet model trained on ATAC-seq in K562 (ENCSR893SUD)**.

### Step 1: Find the model annotation page
Navigate to the ChromBPNet model annotation for ENCSR893SUD (ATAC in K562 cells): [https://www.encodeproject.org/annotations/ENCSR893SUD/](https://www.encodeproject.org/annotations/ENCSR893SUD/). 
The model annotations associated with an experiment can be found on the corresponding experiment summary page. 

![Figure 1](Fig1.png "Screenshot of the ENCODE Portal for a ChromBPNet model (ENCSR893SUD).")

A list of all available annotations is also available here: [https://www.encodeproject.org/annotations/](https://www.encodeproject.org/annotations/).

### Step 2: Find the files of interest
To browse the available files, scroll down to the middle of the page and select the **“File details”** tab. 
For any initial exploratory analysis, we recommend comparing the normalized observed signal, the predicted signal and the counts contribution scores bigWigs.

![Figure 2](Fig2-3.png "Screenshot of the ENCODE Portal of 'File details' for a ChromBPNet model (ENCSR893SUD).")

The following steps will require the URLs to these bigwigs, which can be found by right clicking the **download icon**, and clicking **“Copy link address”**. The links are provided here for convenience:

- **Normalized observed signal profile**: [https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF880ZUI/@@download/ENCFF880ZUI.bigWig](https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF880ZUI/@@download/ENCFF880ZUI.bigWig)
- **Normalized predicted signal profile**: [https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF296ICJ/@@download/ENCFF296ICJ.bigWig](https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF296ICJ/@@download/ENCFF296ICJ.bigWig)
- **Counts sequence contribution scores**: [https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF407GCO/@@download/ENCFF407GCO.bigWig](https://www.encodeproject.org/files/ENCFF407GCO/@@download/ENCFF407GCO.bigWig)

For more information regarding the various files that are available, see the [**ENCODE 4 preprint**](https://doi.org/10.64898/2026.07.06.731365).

### Step 3: Load the bigwigs into the WashU genome browser
Navigate to the WashU browser page: [https://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/browser2022/](https://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/browser2022/). On the home page, find the **“Human”** section and select **“hg38”** to open a new browser session:

![Figure 3](Fig3.png "Screenshot of the WashU Genome Browser: Home.")

After opening a new browser session, select the **“Tracks”** icon at the top of the page, and then select the **“Remote Tracks”** button from the dropdown menu:

![Figure 4](Fig4.png "Screenshot of the WashU Genome Browser: Browser (Tracks).")

You should next see a window that looks like below:

![Figure 5](Fig5.png "Screenshot of the WashU Genome Browser: Browser (Add remote tracks).")

Copy and paste each of the first two URLs from Step 2 and add a label (e.g., observed and predicted, respectively). 
After each one first click **“Submit”** at the bottom of the window:

![Figure 6](Fig6.png "Screenshot of the WashU Genome Browser: Browser (Add remote tracks: Submit).")

Then click **“Add another track”**:

![Figure 7](Fig7.png "Screenshot of the WashU Genome Browser: Browser (Add remote tracks: Add another track).")

For the third bigwig, the contribution scores, we will change the Track type to **Dynseq**, by clicking on the **“Track type”** box and scrolling to the fifth track option on the list:

![Figure 8](Fig8.png "Screenshot of the WashU Genome Browser: Browser (Add remote tracks: dynseq - dynamic sequence).")

This allows us to visualize the contributions of individual nucleotides in the region to the predictions of the modelled assay (zoom in for the bases to render). 
Small clusters of high contribution score bases typically represent transcription factor binding motifs.

Add a label to this track: for example “counts contribution scores”.

The final browser view should look something like below:

![Figure 9](Fig9.png "Screenshot of the WashU Genome Browser: Browser (With tracks).")

For additional information regarding how to use the WashU browser, see the documentation: [https://epigenomegateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html](https://epigenomegateway.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).

## How else can I use the resources?
As part of the ENCODE Project, all data, models, analysis are shared **without restriction** at the [Project portal](https://www.encodeproject.org/). There are many other valuable resources available, so we highly recommend checking it out.

Additionally, we have tried our best to make the resource as user-friendly as possible: 
- **Models**: We have uploaded the models for open access on [**Hugging Face**](https://huggingface.co/collections/kundajelab/encode-bpnet-models) 
- **Model predictions, contributions and instance tracks**: We have created a [**UCSC Track Hub**](https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTracks?db=hg38&hubUrl=https://kundajelab.github.io/ucsc-trackhub-encode.github.io/hub.txt) for easy, interactive browser sessions
- **User guide**: We are currently building an _interactive_ user guide to help the community navigate and explain the resource (_work in progress_)
- **Preprint**: For more detail, the latest ENCODE preprint is out on [_bioRxiv_](https://doi.org/10.64898/2026.07.06.731365)

Lastly, we still have so much to share about the resource: we are planning to regularly share the many different ways you can use the resource (every week) for the foreseeable future, so give us a follow and be on the lookout for more!
